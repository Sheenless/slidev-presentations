### Pathway to agriculture today

<v-clicks depth='2'>

* Develops about 12,000 years ago in a shift from hunter-gather communities
* Crops:
  * Neolithic founder crops: bitter vetch, chickpeas, emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, flax, hulled barley, peas & lentils 
  * China: Rice, azuki, mung, soy beans
  * Africa:  African rice, black eyed pea, coffee, cowpeas, finger millet, ensete, noog, okra pearl millet, plantains, sorghum, teff, watermelon & yams.
  * South America:  Beans, cassava, chilli, cotton, maize, peanuts, squash & tomatoes.

## "Variety"

A **variety** is a group of plants that share the same physical characteristics, as a result of their _genetics_
interacting with the _environment_.

<v-clicks>

**Distinct (D):** A new variety must have at least one important characteristic that is different from other varieties of the same species that are already in common knowledge - used to identify the new variety as a unique entry. 

**Uniform (U):** The new variety plants must be consistent in their characteristics. Tolerable variation is species-specific, but in general, individual plants should appear and perform similarly. 

**Stable (S):** The variety's key characteristics must remain unchanged after it is repeatedly propagated through seeds, cuttings, or other means. This ensures that the variety perform reliably for breeders and consumers.

  ## The discovery of inherited genes
  
  <v-clicks depth='2'>

  * Around 1860, Gregor Mendel began work on the "laws of inheritance" showing:
    * Traits were inherited from parents
    * Traits are dominant or recessive
    * These traits are due to 'factors' - 'genes' as we know them today.
    * Traits of offspring could be predicted
    * That recessive genes are still carried in the offspring

| **Name** | **Description** |
|:---|:---| 
| Traditional variety | A variety that has been used by communities over generations through saved seed. |
| Local variety | A variety that is well adapted to local conditions, often derived from transgenerational selection by farmers. |
| Landrace | A variety that has developed naturally through adaptation to the local environment and traditional farming practices. Tend to be genetically diverse |
| Modern variety | A variety that has been improved using bioscience and advanced breeding techniques to contain specific traits. Selection is often at the genetic level. Genetic variation is very low between individuals of the same variety. |
| Improved variety | A variety that has received targeted plant breeding efforts to introduce or enhance specific traits. This improvement is the result of advanced breeding techniques, with selection at the genetic level. |
| Elite cultivar | A carefully selected bred crop line that contains the best traits offered by breeders. Elite cultivars are the end products offered to farmers from breeding platforms. They are continually improved through the introgression better genes |

## Quick recap
<br>
<v-clicks depth='2'>

* Since humans shifted to agriculture, we have been artificially selecting crops to meet our needs:
  * Growing faster (early maturity)
  * Tasting better
  * Bigger fruits
  * Suited to farming methods 
* These changes come from genetic manipulation
  * Most of these crops would be outcompeted by wild species without our intervention
* Although many crops exists, global production focuses on a limited set

## Patterns in productivity increases

<v-clicks depth='2'>

* The Green Revolution and ongoing crop breeding and technology improvements have dramatically increased yields.
  * These productivity increases allow us to feed the world today
* These productivity increases have not been equally realised globally
* Often framed as a problem of a shortfall in technology use:
  * Fertiliser
  * Irrigation
  * Shifts to "modern" or "improved" varieties

<!-- 
The formal seed system follows a linear breeding approach, with researchers and breeders developing varieties, and private actors tasked with downstream seed marketing and farmer adoption (Cleveland 2001; Mastenbroek and Ntare 2016). This model was proposed as the primary model for rural development that gained popularity during 90s neoliberalisation (Ellis and Biggs 2001; Lynam 2011). The same model is often presented as the path to a Green Revolution in Africa (Toenniessen, Adesina, and DeVries 2008; Scoones and Thompson 2011; Odame and Muange 2011). The aim is link farmers with the latest crop breeding breakthroughs, packaged in products which are tightly regulated for high quality. The system is maintained by ongoing farmer demand for new varieties, and market competition to drive product improvement. The general production of seed for extension can be broken down as follows:

Approximately 90% of the seed sub-Saharan farmers acquire is from informal seed systems (McGuire and Sperling 2016). Some argue that these systems should be called ‘farmer seed networks’ as the ‘informal’ label unfairly suggests a casual, unstructured arrangement (Coomes et al. 2015). On the contrary, informal seed systems are comprised of complex networks of actors and social interactions around seed exchange. They enable smallholders with a wide range of cropping strategies and changing needs (Bazile et al. 2005; McGuire 2005; Poudel, Sthapit and Shrestha 2015). This makes them a critical resilience option for subsistence farmers (McGuire and Sperling 2013)

## Rights and control
<br>
<v-clicks>

* <u>Plant Variety Protection / Plant Breeders’ Rights (PVP / PBR)</u>: Protects varieties that meet DUS criteria. Usually confers exclusive rights to produce and market seed of the protected variety name.
  * Farmers typically may buy and plant; saving and replanting seed depends on national law.
* <u>Patents (traits, genes, enabling technologies)</u>: Protect inventions. Farmers and breeders face licensing obligations in reusing the technology.
* <u>Hybrids versus OPV</u>: similar. OPV can have stronger reliance on PBR and/or patent-protected traits and contracts.
* <u>Multilateral systems vs bilateral access</u> The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) provides a Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) for listed crops; other materials fall under Nagoya Protocol–style bilateral access and benefit sharing (ABS).

## Rights and control
<br>
<v-clicks>

* Dimensions of power, control, risk and benefits explain contemporary struggles over seed systems. 
* Since the 80s-90s, global legal and market structures have been re-engineered so that a small number of firms and high-income states exercise growing control over seeds, traits and knowledge. 
* Intellectual property (IP) rules (patents, plant variety protection, PVP/UPOV) and contract law are the pivotal instruments that shape who can innovate, who can farm what, and who captures value. 
* Generally plant breeders rights have become more powerful than farmers' rights, and often entrench power in Western countries.

## Seed security

is a situation where farmers have sustainable access to the correct quantity and quality of seeds and planting materials for their crops, ensuring they can plant their fields and produce food for their families. 

It is based on four components: seed availability, access, suitability, and quality.

<v-clicks>

* In disaster situations, a pressing need to get seeds out to help communities recover.
* Often delivered as direct seed distribution
* But risks to local seed systems, and can put farmers in worse situations.
* Need systems that are gender responsive, and strengthens channels that farmers normally use (both formal and informal)

## The transformation of seed systems

<br>
<v-clicks depth='2'>

* "Reliance on old varieties in informal seed systems is holding farmers back."
  * Old varieties
  * Limited selection
  * Poor quality 
* Proses transformative shift to certified seed on quality and productivity grounds.

## Misconceptions around informal seed systems:
<br>
<v-clicks>

1. Farmer seed networks are inefficient for seed dissemination. 
2. Farmer seed networks are closed, conservative systems.
3. Farmer seed networks provide ready, egalitarian access to seed.
4. Farmer seed networks are destined to weaken and disappear.

</v-clicks>

<br>
<v-clicks>

* Farmer seed networks are efficient and open but also selective in seed provisioning.
* Commercialisation and regulation are unlikely to eradicate farmer seed networks.

## Misconceptions on informal seed systems:
<br>

<v-clicks depth='2'>

* Risks of romanticising
  * A driver of varietal diversity
  * Maintain traditional varieties
  * Somehow contain more nutritious / healthier products
  * Part of lower environmental agriculture
  * Ensure perpetuity of heirloom varieties
* Separate to certified varieties

## Rise in interest in 'opportunity crops'
<br>
<v-clicks>

* Growing interest in neglected and underutilised species (NUS) for for more resilient and nutritious agriculture.
* Identification of particularly promising crops and varieties - 'opportunity crops'.
* Expanding these to areas most threatened by climate change.

## Connecting national genebanks with informal seed systems
<br>
<v-clicks depth='2'> 

* National genebanks are full of locally adapted varieties
* Yet often poor connections to farmers
* Participatory approach:
  * Farmers assess genebank collections.
  * Genebanks bulk seed and share with farmers.
  * Farmers continue to engage and share with genebanks.

## The business case for grasspea
<br>

<v-clicks depth="2"> 

* An opportunity crop: one of the most tolerant legumes and highly proteinous.
* But a major challenge: toxicity
* We can make safer varieties, but difficult to sustainably get to farmers.
  * Accessibility challenges
  * Access challenges
  * Need to repurchase
* Good case study of linking up formally improved opportunity crops with informal seed systems.
